# Dotfiles

## Why is it almost empty?
The changes are incremental, moving from a private dotfiles repository to a
public one (this repo). So it's normal if it's empty, I review my current
dotfiles and make sure to remove the unwanted config or improve it.

## How to use it?
On Windows: ? (for emacs the README in it defines how to do it).

On Linux: use GNU stow
